//controlled element
//1.define a piece of state
//2. use that piece of state on the element we want to control (force the element to always take the value of this state variable)
//3. update that state variable. you do it with on change handler.
//with this forms are now in charge of react not dom element

//our from elements, by default, maintain their own state inside hte DOM(html element itself).
//it makes it hard to read their values and also leaves this state right here in the DOM
//In react, we usually like to keep all the state in just one central place.
//Inside the React application and not inside the DOM.
//In order to do that we use a technique controlled element.
//with this, React now has a control of these input fields and no longer the DOM.
